# My Typinator Sets
I wrote about how I use [Typinator](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/typinator.html) and [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.html) together to automate writing in an article you can read [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

Here you can find the different Sets that I use from Typinator to speed up my writing.

The Sets can be found in [this folder](./sets) and here is their explanation. I activate nearly all the snippets from Typinator quick search and thus most snippets won't have any kind of trigger.

1. Words - Single word expansions of words with more than 5-6 characters.
2. Phrases - Some phrases I find myself saying often.
3. Sentences - Common sentences I found myself saying.
4. Questions - Common questions I found myself asking.
5. Corrections - Simple corrections like expanding 'eg ' to 'e.g.'.
6. Smart paste - Snippets with more complex embeddings like AppleScript output.
7. Dates - Expanding current date in different formats like DD/MM/YYYY.
8. Bash - Bash snippets.
9. Markdown - Quick expansions of badges and other things.
10. HTML - HTML snippets.
11. Fantastical - Expansions for [easing entering of natural input](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) in [Fantastical app](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/fantastical.html).
12. VS Code - Currently only holds `alfred build` task template. For code snippets, I use VS Code snippet engine itself.

I use the same trick as in [KM](../km-macros) to indicate what information I should have in my clipboard before activating it by enclosing it inside `{}` like so:
